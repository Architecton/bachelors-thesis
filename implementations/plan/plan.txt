0. Clean up folder.
1. Implement a library of metric learning algorithms.
2. Identify and implement other RBAs that could be implemented.
3. Construct framework for evaluating algorithms and metrics (main python program with CLI)
4. Get datasets and construct sample artificial datasets. Use correlation coefficient to evaluate performance on artificial datasets.

5. Appendix... Using RBAs in ensemble learning.
