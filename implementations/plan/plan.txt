1. Implement a library of metric learning algorithms.   #
2. Identify and implement other RBAs that could be implemented.
3. Get datasets and construct sample artificial datasets. Use correlation coefficient to evaluate performance on artificial datasets.
4. Compare RBA weights/rankings to feature selection using random forests and other methods.

Appendix... Using RBAs in ensemble learning.
