\bar(m)_{n} is defined as the average values of absolute values of vector subtractions.
\nu_{n} is a scalar. w^{T}\nu is a dot product.

we want to find values of w that will maximize the value of w^{t}\nu.
Since norm(w) must be equal to 1. The vector that maximizes this value is a unit vector that points in the same direction - \nu/norm(\nu)
